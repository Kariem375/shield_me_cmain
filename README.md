# 🛡️ ShieldMe — AI-Powered Cybersecurity Awareness Platform

> **Defense through Education.** ShieldMe combines machine learning, YARA signature detection, and generative AI to protect users from phishing, scams, malware, and social engineering attacks — and explain *why* something is dangerous in plain language.

## 📖 About the Project

ShieldMe is a full-stack cybersecurity platform built to help everyday users identify and understand digital threats. It provides a **Unified Threat Scanner** with three independent detection engines operating simultaneously:

1. **Email / Text Scanner** — ML-based spam and phishing classifier
2. **URL Scanner** — Structural feature analysis to detect malicious links
3. **File Scanner** — YARA signature engine for malware and web shell detection

Every scan result is enhanced by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, which translates the machine's verdict into a clear, structured explanation with actionable advice — bridging the gap between technical detection and user understanding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- A [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shieldme.git
cd shieldme

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors yara-python joblib scikit-learn pandas \
            google-generativeai python-dotenv markdown

# 3. Set up your environment variables (see below)
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file.** Make sure it is listed in your `.gitignore`.

---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
# Start the Flask backend
python app.py
```

The backend will start on **http://localhost:5000**

For the frontend, either open `index.html` directly in your browser, or deploy it to Firebase (see [Deployment](#-deployment)).

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### `/scan` — Unified Endpoint

All threat detection is routed through a single `POST /scan` endpoint:

```
Frontend → POST /scan
             │
             ├── Text / URL input?
             │     ├── Starts with http:// or www.? → URL Model → Gemini Explanation
             │     └── Plain text?                  → Email Model → Gemini Explanation
             │
             └── File upload?
                   └── YARA Engine → Threat Description (Arabic + English)
```

### Gemini AI Integration

After every local model prediction, the result is passed to `chatbot.py`, which constructs a structured cybersecurity prompt combining the original input and the ML verdict. Gemini returns a response with:

1. A direct answer (safe or dangerous)
2. A "Why?" explanation
3. A numbered breakdown of suspicious indicators
4. An "Advice:" section with actionable steps

The Markdown response is converted to HTML using Python's `markdown` library before being sent to the frontend.

## 🧨 Threat Coverage

### Email / Text Threats
| Threat Type | Trigger Keywords |
|---|---|
| Phishing Attack | password, login, verify, account |
| Prize Scam | winner, prize, lottery, reward |
| Financial Fraud | bank, payment, credit card |
| General Spam | any other spam pattern |

### File Threats (YARA Rules)
| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| `Suspicious_PDF_With_JS` | PDF with hidden auto-executing JavaScript |
| `Suspicious_PDF_External_Launch` | PDF that launches external programs |
| `Malicious_Office_Macro` | Office document with suspicious VBA macros |
| `PHP_WebShell_Commands` | PHP web shell for server compromise |
| `Suspicious_Memory_Injection` | Code injection into running processes |
| `InfoStealer_Browser_Data` | Credential harvesting from browsers |
| `Hidden_PowerShell_Execution` | Obfuscated PowerShell bypass attempts |

### URL Features Analyzed
`url_length` · `count_dots` · `count_slash` · `count_digits` · `digit_ratio` · `is_https` · `has_ip` · `path_length` · `hostname_length` · `count_subdomains`

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The frontend is deployed via **Firebase Hosting**.

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login and deploy
firebase login
firebase deploy
```

Firebase is configured to route all paths to `index.html` (SPA mode), as defined in `firebase.json`.

The Flask backend should be deployed separately (e.g., on a cloud VM, Railway, or Render) and the frontend `script.js` updated to point to the live backend URL.
